  <div class="paragraph">
  <p>I'm a self taught front end developer who loves coding.  Most of my jobs have been technology adjacent.  I was selling, managing, or training people to use someone else's creations.  This was satisfying for the most part, I enjoyed the interactions with my clients, translating tech to plain English, it was very rewarding seeing the lightbulbs go off above their heads, but something was missing.  I was yearning to let my own creative juices flow, make my own whatever's that people would use and benefit from.</p>
  <p>I pushed the urge to the back of my mind for as long as I could and then one day, I made a decision.  Having no clue as to which direction I should take or how I could possibly get to where I wanted to go, I started searching.  Finally, I took a step, and it felt great. I regained this almost childlike wonderment and curiosity.  The more I learned, the more I found there was to learn.  One more hill to ski, one more wave to ride, for every roadblock, there was a path that was just within reach.  There's always a cool new tool to play with.  Yeah, I was hooked.</p>
  <p>I've had so many amazing mentors and teacher's along the way, <a href="https://watchandcode.com" target="_blank"> Gordon Zhu</a>,  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC46wWUso9H5KPQcoL9iE3Ug" target="_blank"> Joe from Coding Phase</a>,<a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/TheCharmefis/featured" target="_blank"> Daniel from mmtuts</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCshZ3rdoCLjDYuTR_RBubzw" target="_blank"> Erik Hanchett</a> and <a href="https://www.udemy.com/" target="_blank">Udemy</a> courses among so many others.  If you're interested in web development but need some direction, or a hand, or wonder what you got yourself into, shoot me an <a href="index.html#Contact">e-mail</a>.  The best thing that I have found is how welcoming, helpful, and encouraging the community can be and I am more than thrilled to be a part of it.  Pay it forward...</p>
  <p> You can find me on github <a href="https://github.io/laneeverhart" target="_blank" style="color:blue"> here.</a> Download my resume <a href="Lane's Resume.pdf" download style="color:blue">here</a>, or connect with me <a href="mailto:laneeverhart@yahoo.com" style="color:blue">here</a>.  Oh yeah, the dog that keeps popping up in my pictures is Neo, he's awesome.</p>
